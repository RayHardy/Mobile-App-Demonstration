# Mobile-App-Demonstration

A way to create a webpage that will display a mobile app for previewing at events. 

The layout is completely changable and will need to be configured to whatever your needs are.

The code for the app is very basic so if you want to use for actual mobile app development you will need to implement in a more object oriented manner. There is some objects created with the app but will need to improved.

This app is only front end so when you save things it is only saved during the browser session. Once the webpage is refreshed then the app will clear itself. If you wish to tie into a backend you will need to add all of that.
